  My name They Kai Zhe (you can call me Kai Zhe or kyze when messaging me online), my pronouns are he/him and I'm from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I'm 19 years of age at the time of writing this (2023) and I'm currently a student at APU (Asia Pacific University), enrolling in a Computer Science degree programme.
  
  I have an interest in developing technology such as AI, chatbots, as well as the  automation of tasks and backend systems. I also have some interest in 3D printing and is considering looking into building with PCBs. Currently, I'm learning the basics of coding and programming in languages such as Python, C, Java, HTML, javascript and CSS. I would like to one day, work with a company that is developing AI solutions that are able to help developing societies/countries with low/no costs. I'm still looking for a mentor that can provide some tips/advice or a general direction so that I can come up with an effective roadmap that I can use to improve my skills and expand my skillset.
  
 My hobbies include:
  - playing video games (Minecraft, Fate/Grand Order, Genshin Impact, Apex Legends)
  - watching Youtube & Netflix
  - solving coding questions on CSES/LeetCode/CodeChef
  - playing the Rubik's Cube
  - typing
